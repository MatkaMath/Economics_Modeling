# Solow Growth Model Simulation

This project simulates economic growth using the **Solow-Swan model**, incorporating **capital accumulation, labor growth, and technological progress**. The model also includes **policy interventions and economic shocks** to analyze their impacts on economic development.

## üìà Features
- **Core Solow Growth Model**: Simulates capital accumulation, population growth, and technology improvements.
- **Policy Intervention**: Adjusts the savings rate at a specific time to reflect government policies.
- **Economic Shock**: Introduces a temporary drop in technology to model real-world recessions.
- **Steady-State Analysis**: Compares simulated results to theoretical steady-state values.
- **Consumption Calculation**: Includes consumption trends for a comprehensive economic analysis.
- **Logarithmic Scale Visualization**: Provides a better view of long-term economic growth.

## üõ† Installation & Usage
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed along with the required libraries.

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib

```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Simulation
Run the Python script to generate the simulation graphs.
```bash
python solow_growth.py
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ View the Output
The program will generate a plot showing the changes in capital, output, labor, and technology over time, along with policy interventions and economic shocks.

## üî¨ Real-World Applications
This model helps analyze:
- **The impact of government policies** on economic growth.
- **How economies recover from recessions.**
- **The role of technology and savings** in long-term development.
